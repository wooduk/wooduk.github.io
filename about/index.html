         <h1>About me</h1>
         <p><em>Warning: this is a fairly long narrative. If you rather just see the bullet points of my CV please visit <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wooduk/">LinkedIn</a></em></p>

<p>At the beginning of the 21st century I left Durham University with a degree in Physics, calloused hands, and some fresh memories of <a href="https://www.madventurer.com/kenya">summers in East Africa</a>. I moved the length of the country to begin work for a company called <a href="https://www.qinetiq.com/">QinetiQ</a> a defence contractor who I had admired since watching an episode of the <a href="http://www.www.com">UK Challenge</a> some years earlier. Although I did take part in that same challenge for QinetiQ while I was there, the real work I did was developing models of radar systems using a mixture of MATLAB and C++ , writing reports, and bidding for new work. After about 5 years of this I decided it was time for a change of direction.</p>

<p>The mid 2000s had seen a resurgence in concern about climate change. If you were paying attention at the time you might remember Al Gore&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/">An Inconvenient Truth</a>&rdquo; or the release of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_Review">Stern Review</a> in 2006?. I moved to London and took a <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/environmental-policy/environmental-technology/">Masters in Environmental Technology at Imperial College London</a>, focussing on global environmental policy. In some ways this was a return to a previous interest that was sparked by those trips to East Africa. And in fact I had continued to develop this interest through spare-time studies in <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/td223">International Development</a> since leaving University. I did love the computer programming aspect of my job at QinetiQ but also had an itch to somehow go beyond such a narrow focus. At the outset of the Masters I thought it was likely that I would end up applying my analysis and computing skills to social and environmental problems but secretly hoped to switch into &lsquo;policy&rsquo; work - whatever that was.</p>

<p>But the course was a mind-opening experience in ways that I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated. At the encouragement of our supervising lecturer I entered an Business Plan competition being run by Walmart, the U.S. retail chain. After winning our regional heats I found myself at Walmart&rsquo;s HQ in Arkansas pitching a social data aggregation service that would provide personalised eco-labels to their customers. Yes, quite. The idea was not a winner but this little adventure had piqued my interest in the possibilities of what was then called &lsquo;Web 2.0&rsquo;. This was around around the time Microsoft was buying a stake in Facebook and the second iPhone was coming out. I spent the spring and summer trying to use the required Masters thesis as a vehicle to amalgamate my previous system modelling and analysis skills with these new interests in social web technologies all within a sustainability theme. The final document (entitled &ldquo;The potential impact of Web 2.0 technologies on the behaviour of consumers of ethical products&rdquo;) got me a Distinction. This was good and bad. On the one hand I was pleased with the grade on the other it made me think all these interests could be pursued at the same time, rather than choosing something and pursuing that. However, I was now fascinated by the how people built and launched web-based businesses and the impact they could have on the world.</p>

<p>To get paid while learning more about all of this I started on a Engineering Doctorate with the University of Surrey and Hewlett-Packard Labs. That probably doesn&rsquo;t sound like the most obvious thing to do but the proposed title of Doctorate was almost a perfect overlap with the Thesis topic I just described and the Engineering Doctorate involved being placed at the host organisation rather than at a Univeristy. However, 6 months in, a reorganisation at HP meant the team I was working with at HP was dispanded.  HP were excellent and offered either me the choice of another project or to pay out the sponsorship money to the University so that I could continue on the programme and try to find another sponsor. I took the latter and after some time was reunited with some of the old HP team, who were in new roles with the University of Bristol, as they embarked on a new project at The Guardian. It was fascinating being embedded in a team at the Guardian&rsquo;s London headquarters in King&rsquo;s Cross. The project was about helping them understand to understand the energy used delivering digital media within a wider framework of sustainable journalism. The wider context at this time was about print publishing organisations making a transistion to being digital media organisations. With further personel changes at the Guardian and at the University  How can you design a website to make it sustainable. The world of web analytics and usability. The visualisation of data, deisgn thinking, I didn&rsquo;t complete the Doctorate but I did pick up many of the skills that got me my next job. It&rsquo;s nice to see these subjects.</p>

<p>Looking for work I stumbled into working for an Internet-of-Things company. I worked in Data Science team. In addition to business analyitcs, (SQL, Adobe SiteCatalyst) Customer segmentation</p>

<p>We moved to Japan and lived in Tokyo for a couple of years. Fascinating.</p>

<p>Returned to Europe. Looking for work.</p>
